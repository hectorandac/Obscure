In the landscape of object detection, the YOLO (You Only Look Once) methodology has revolutionized real-time applications with its single-pass detection capabilities. However, traditional YOLO architectures often process vast amounts of data, leading to unnecessary computational overhead and limiting deployment in resource-constrained environments. Our research introduces ``Gated YOLO,'' an adaptation of the YOLO framework, incorporating a gating mechanism to enhance computational efficiency while maintaining detection accuracy.

This method integrates a mechanism that adjusts the activation of neural pathways based on the relevance to the observed scene. During the training phase, our approach identifies and deactivates consistently inactive neural pathways across specific environmental conditions. This strategic deactivation reduces redundant computational weight, making the model more efficient for its designated tasks.

Our empirical results demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces computational load with minimal impact on detection accuracy, elevating processing speeds. This makes it an effective solution for real-time object detection in fixed, resource-constrained environments, such as security camera systems.

In summary, Gated YOLO represents a significant advancement towards more resource-efficient object detection solutions. By tailoring model processing pathways to specific environmental demands, this research enhances the applicability and effectiveness of real-time object detection systems in static settings.

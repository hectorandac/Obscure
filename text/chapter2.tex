\section{Related Work}  

The exploration of efficiency within neural network architectures, particularly for object detection in computationally constrained environments, constitutes a significant area of research. This section delves into various methodologies and developments that have shaped the current landscape of efficient neural network design, highlighting the relevance and novelty of our approach within this context.

\subsection{Sparsity and Conditional Computation}

A fundamental concept in the pursuit of neural network efficiency is the integration of sparsity and conditional computation mechanisms. Sparsity in neural networks refers to the idea that not all neurons or connections (weights) are necessary for every input. By identifying and activating only a subset of the neural pathways for a given input, significant reductions in computational overhead can be achieved without sacrificing the model's ability to represent complex functions. This principle is akin to how decision trees operate, where at each node a decision is made that leads to a subset of the next possible states, thus not exploring all branches of the tree for a given input.

The concept of conditional computation extends this idea further by introducing mechanisms that allow a neural network to adapt its computation pathways dynamically based on the input. This adaptability ensures that only the most relevant parts of the network are engaged during the forward pass, which not only saves computational resources but also helps in reducing overfitting by limiting the effective capacity of the model based on the complexity of the input.

Introduced by Bengio et al. \cite{bengio2013deep}, the idea of selectively activating neural pathways has been a cornerstone in the development of more efficient neural network architectures. The authors suggest that such mechanisms could allow for deeper and more complex models by allocating computational resources more judiciously. By simulating sparsity and conditional computation, networks can potentially achieve a balance between depth and width, optimizing the computational cost without compromising the benefits of distributed representations.

Several other approaches have been proposed to implement sparsity and conditional computation in neural networks. For example, the approach based on gating mechanisms, where gates control the flow of information in the network, effectively turning on or off certain pathways based on the input. Chen et al. introduced GaterNet  \cite{chen2019you}, where a gater network generates binary gates for selectively activating filters in the backbone network based on each input. Their experiments on \ignore{TODO: Check this paper actually perform tests on these two datasets} CIFAR and ImageNet datasets show models consistently outperform original models with a large margin.

The brilliance of dynamic filter selection lies in its capacity to maintain high levels of accuracy while dramatically enhancing computational efficiency. This is especially pertinent for applications requiring real-time processing. Moreover, the adaptability of GaterNet enables the CNN to focus its computational power on the most informative features of the input. Despite its advantages, the design and training of a gating network that can accurately predict the most effective filters for any given input pose substantial challenges, requiring careful consideration of the trade-offs between complexity, efficiency, and accuracy.

Additionally, Veit and Belongie propose adaptive inference graphs in convolutional networks \cite{veit2020convolutional}, dynamically selecting the parts of the network to use for each input to reduce computational requirements.

There are notable approaches the follow a similar line of thinking we followed for our approach, for instance, Dynamic Sparse Training (DST), as proposed by Liu et al. \cite{liu2020dynamic}, represents a significant leap forward from static sparsity models towards a more flexible and efficient neural network architecture. DST addresses one of the primary concerns in neural network efficiency, how to use the minimal number of parameters without sacrificing the model's ability to learn complex patterns. Unlike traditional training methods that rely on a fixed architecture, DST allows the network to adjust its architecture dynamically during the training process. This is achieved by periodically redistributing the network's connections to focus more on those that are most beneficial for learning the current task. 

The key innovation of DST lies in its ability to identify and leverage the most informative connections within a network based on the training data. By doing so, it optimizes both the model capacity and computational resources, directing them towards the aspects of the data that are most crucial for performance. This method not only improves the efficiency of the network but also has the potential to enhance its generalization ability by preventing overfitting to less relevant features. However, implementing DST effectively requires sophisticated mechanisms for deciding when and how to adjust the network's sparsity. This dynamic adjustment process introduces additional complexity and computational overhead, which can be challenging to manage, particularly in environments where computational resources are strictly limited.

Lastly, Emerging research by Kalwar et al. \cite{kalwar2023gdip}, titled 'GDIP: Object-Detection in Adverse Weather Conditions Using Gated Differentiable Image Processing,' explores object detection under challenging environmental conditions. Utilizing a gated image processing technique, this work provides a novel perspective on efficiency and adaptability, presenting a potential area for future comparative studies with our gated scene-specific approach.

\subsection{Neural Network Pruning}

Neural network pruning, a process aimed at reducing model complexity by eliminating redundant or non-significant weights, represents a critical strategy for enhancing computational efficiency without substantially sacrificing accuracy. This technique not only aids in alleviating the storage and computational burdens but also can lead to faster inference times and reduced energy consumption, making models more viable for deployment on resource-constrained devices.

\textbf{Gradient-based Pruning.} Zhang et al. \cite{zhang2023neural} introduced a sophisticated method leveraging gradient descent for pruning, which systematically identifies and eliminates less critical connections within the network. This approach prioritizes the preservation of model performance while streamlining its architecture, thereby achieving an optimal balance between efficiency and robustness. Such gradient-based methods illuminate the path towards more adaptive and intelligent pruning strategies, where the decision to prune is deeply integrated with the model's learning process.

\textbf{Iterative Pruning and Retraining.} Han et al. \cite{han2016deep}, on the other hand, showcased a more iterative approach to pruning, which involves periodically removing weights deemed least important according to a predefined criterion, followed by a retraining phase to compensate for any loss in performance. This cycle of pruning and retraining not only results in substantial model compression but also often uncovers more efficient network architectures inherently capable of maintaining high accuracy with fewer parameters. Han's method has become a cornerstone in the field, highlighting the potential for significant efficiency gains even in large and complex models.

While both gradient-based and iterative pruning methods offer avenues to enhance model efficiency, they typically require careful calibration and may introduce additional steps into the model development pipeline, such as determining optimal pruning thresholds and managing the retraining process. Moreover, these methods generally focus on static model optimization, where the pruning decisions, once made, are fixed and do not adapt to changing input patterns or computational constraints at inference time.

\subsection{Efficient Object Detection Models}

The quest for efficiency extends into the domain of object detection, with MobileNet YOLO by Howard et al. \cite{howard2019searching} setting a precedent. By leveraging depth-wise separable convolutions, MobileNet YOLO offers a significant reduction in computational demands while sustaining performance levels, demonstrating the viability of real-time object detection on embedded systems. This integration of MobileNet with the YOLO framework exemplifies the practical application of efficiency-driven design principles in object detection models. \ignore{TODO: Add additional details particularly on the context of hardware efficient YOLO alternatives}

\subsection{Quantization Techniques for Neural Network Efficiency}

Quantization is a process that reduces the precision of the numerical parameters in neural networks, such as weights and activations, from floating-point to lower-bit representations. This technique is crucial for deploying deep learning models on resource-constrained devices due to its ability to significantly reduce model size and computational complexity while maintaining acceptable levels of accuracy.

\textbf{Overview of Quantization.} Krishnamoorthi \cite{krishnamoorthi2018quantizing} provides a comprehensive overview of quantization techniques, highlighting methods for minimizing accuracy loss while achieving considerable reductions in model size and computational requirements. The whitepaper delineates various strategies, including post-training quantization and quantization-aware training, each with its unique approach to balancing efficiency and performance.

\textbf{Efficient Integer-Arithmetic-Only Inference.} Jacob et al. \cite{jacob2018quantization} introduce a quantization framework designed for efficient inference in integer-arithmetic-only environments. This method is particularly beneficial for mobile and embedded devices, where computational resources are limited. By quantizing both the weights and activations of neural networks to integers, their approach enables the use of highly optimized hardware accelerators, further enhancing the efficiency of model inference.

\textbf{Hardware-Aware Automated Quantization.} Moving towards more dynamic quantization strategies, Wang et al. \cite{wang2019haq} propose HAQ, a hardware-aware automated quantization method that utilizes reinforcement learning to determine the optimal mixed precision quantization policy. By considering the unique characteristics of the target hardware, HAQ optimizes the trade-off between model accuracy and computational efficiency, paving the way for customized model deployment across different platforms.

While quantization methods offer significant improvements in model efficiency, they often require careful tuning of quantization parameters to avoid substantial accuracy loss. Additionally, the static nature of most quantization techniques means that once a model is quantized, its ability to dynamically adjust to varying computational resources or input complexities is limited.

\subsection{Knowledge Distillation for Model Efficiency}

Knowledge distillation is a technique that aims to transfer the knowledge from a larger, complex model (teacher) to a smaller, more efficient model (student), allowing the latter to achieve similar performance levels with significantly less computational overhead.

\textbf{Foundational Knowledge Distillation.} The concept of knowledge distillation was popularized by Hinton et al. \cite{hinton2015distilling}, who demonstrated that a smaller model could be trained to mimic the output of a larger model, effectively compressing the knowledge of the larger model into a more compact form. This technique enables the deployment of high-performing models on devices with limited computational resources.

\textbf{Self Distillation.} Exploring an innovative approach, Zhang et al. \cite{zhang2019your} proposed a method of self-distillation, where a single network serves as both teacher and student. This method simplifies the distillation process and leads to performance improvements, showcasing the potential of internal knowledge transfer within the same network architecture.

Knowledge distillation techniques, while effective in reducing model size and computational requirements, often rely on the availability of a pre-trained, large-scale model to serve as the teacher. This dependency can be a limitation in scenarios where such a model is not available or when training a large teacher model is computationally prohibitive. Additionally, the effectiveness of knowledge distillation can vary based on the complexity of the task and the architecture of the models involved. 

\subsection{Our Contribution}

The pursuit of efficiency in neural network models has prompted diverse innovations, like quantization and knowledge distillation, the encouragement of sparcity and neural network pruning. These methods aim to optimize model performance within computational constraints, employing strategies such as reducing parameter precision, transferring knowledge from larger to smaller models, and systematically eliminating less critical connections. However, such techniques frequently encounter inherent limitations, including the need for a large teacher model in knowledge distillation or a loss of dynamic adaptability in static pruning and quantization methods.

In contrast, our approach transcends these methodologies by integrating dynamic gating mechanisms with model pruning, specifically designed for the YOLO architecture. Diverging from conventional strategies that focus on static model compression or necessitate significant auxiliary structures, our method utilizes Improved SemHash to create static gating configurations after training. This innovation not only leads to a substantial decrease in computational demands during inference but also maintains high accuracy and real-time adaptability to fluctuating computational environments or input complexities. This capacity for dynamic adjustment, often lacking in traditional approaches with the exception of some of the other gating based strategies, renders our method particularly suitable for real-time object detection in computationally constrained settings.

In conclusion, building on neural network efficiency advancements, we introduce a novel approach, the "Gated Scene-Specific YOLO." This method not only incorporates dynamic gating and model pruning principles but also customizes these concepts for the YOLO architecture. Our technique for establishing static gating configurations post-training, is abscent in the literature. This distinct strategy significantly reduces computational requirements during inference, distinguishing our work in the real-time object detection landscape. Moreover, our research tackles challenges previously identified in conditional computation and pruning methods, such as model adaptability in dynamically changing environments and maintaining high accuracy levels despite reduced computational complexity. Through a comprehensive comparison with state-of-the-art models, we underscore the practical benefits and superiority of our approach, especially in scenarios constrained by computational resources.
